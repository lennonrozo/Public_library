    <h1>A short study of the African American family in the eighteenth century
    </h1><br><br>
    <p>
        <em>1. What were the strengths and weaknesses of the African American family in the eighteenth
            century?</em><br><br>
        The eighteenth century saw an increase in the demand for labor in plantations, be it in the cotton or rice
        plantations in the North or South. With the value of slaves increasing, but masters permitted by law to own
        slaves indefinitely, it seemed like a good investment to have chattel slaves than indentured slaves. This
        dynamic brought with it consequences that most African American families had to deal with.

    </p><br>
    <p>
        Firstly, black slaves were indivisible when they were together. This was a major strength of the African
        American family. As a result, the African men and women defied their masters, and they frequently refused to
        work. Often, they could not be persuaded by punishment, and they intended to escape. The support of having one’s
        family around gave them the strength not to fear their masters. In the case that they escaped, these families
        became “outliners,” living close to and stealing from their master’s estate.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Secondly, religion was the other strength of the African American family. With most of these slaves having come
        directly from Africa, or one of their ancestors, religion was the glue binding them together. Even if they could
        not marry legally, most black marriages were spiritually sanctioned. Music and dance helped keep their culture
        together which assisted them to adapt to being under new masters and sometimes living under harsh conditions.
        These people had their own musical instruments, cooking methods and food, and unique folk literature.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        One other strength, although stemming from slavery, was the ability of the African Americans to hold skilled
        occupations. As seen in many of these plantations, the blacks became “carpenters, smiths, carters, coopers,
        millers, potters, sawyers, tanners, weavers,” and any other skill that was needed in the place. This enabled the
        African Americans to be able to make their own clothes and furnish their own houses which weren’t always the
        best. They could now own cloths and utensils made from their own hands.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Finally in strengths, the extended black families, brought by the introduction of last names to preserve kinship
        dominated almost any other type of family. As kids were often sold when they reached some age, carrying their
        family name ensured the name would stay forever and that wherever they go they may find relatives making their
        relocation easier.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        However, the African American family didn’t always enjoy their lives as seen through the harsh treatment they
        received from their masters. The major setback or weakness was that the whites still had authority over them. As
        a result, most black families were tied to that master. Also, since the amendment of the law that ensured a
        child would inherit their mother’s condition, be either slave or free if the mother is such, white masters had
        the freedom to molest and abuse black women since they knew the children would be slaves as well. African
        American men could not protect her from their masters.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Secondly, most blacks had no personal property or rights that whites had to respect. This led to the harsh
        treatment and exploitation of the blacks. As these people were not allowed to testify against the white people
        or seek justice, it enabled the white masters to get away with any crime. This unfairness prompted most blacks
        to kill their masters to get revenge. Black people could also not bear arms.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Next, blacks could not leave their master’s property without a pass, congregate in groups, enter contract, or
        even marry. Even converting to Christianity which had been an avenue to gain freedom for most blacks prior was
        no longer a way for manumission. They worked so much because the masters wanted to get as much as they could
        from their investment. This resulted in most African American slaves dying because of overwork or disease.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        To conclude, I believe the African American family had more weaknesses than strengths because although they
        could marry, even though illegal, there was a time when the ratio of men to women was so low that “Anthony
        Johnson’s wife Mary was recorded to be the only women around in their area around 1725”. Also, the working
        conditions, laws restricting them, and being likened to an animal because they were someone else’s property, all
        support this claim. However, because they had each other, religion, music, food, and some became skilled crafts
        people, the African American family did have something in their lives to be delighted for or look forward to.
        However, the bad outweighs the good.
