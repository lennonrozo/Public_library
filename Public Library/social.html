        Social Media: Poison for Teens
    </h1>><br>
    <p>
        In a world where technology dictates everything it’s not surprising that teens spend most of their time on their
        cellphones going through social media. They post stories about their lives including their grief and sorrows.
        Often, these cries for help go unnoticed because the people watching are not trained or compassionate enough to
        notice the red flags. With the growth of the influencer culture where celebrities and famous people have the
        power to influence others, social media may encourage suicidal thoughts especially since teens see famous people
        committing suicide. As a result, social media is to blame for many teen suicides due to the significant amount
        of time spent on social media by teens compared to that with family, loved ones, or any other outside activity.
    </p><br>

        With the growing popularity of vlogs and forums, some teens use these to research and share suicide methods. A
        systematic review examining how the internet affects risk for self-harm and suicide in youth found that internet
        forums discussing self-harm and suicide often focused on execution and techniques (Biddle 370-375). There is
        little to no regulation of the content provided on these sites thus exposing teens to detrimental content.
        Between 2007 and 2014, the number of websites that included information on suicide methodology tripled, whereas
        websites designed to provide support to those contemplating suicide decreased by half (Marchant, Hawton and
        Stewart). Social media gives rise to exposure to suicidal encouragement. Celebrities and famous people have
        become influencers promoting desirable behavior and trends, and their lifestyle choices are easily mirrored by
        teens. However, after a celebrity suicide, the incidence of suicide in the general population increased solely
        if the death elicited a significant reaction from Twitter users (Ueda, Mori and Sawada). Social media is like a
        one stop shop for everything suicide for teens and this is worrisome. Given how teens not only have
        encouragement to commit suicide but the means to do it, there should be stricter regulations and physicians must
        be allowed access to these troubled teens’ media to combat suicide and potentially help affected teens.
    </p><br>

        Given the immense number of stressors teens face coupled with their desire for freedom from parents, most teens
        flock to social media to seek comfort and sympathy. Social media offers them an environment where they are
        surrounded by peers, hence these platforms become safe havens where they express suicidality as young people who
        use social media are more likely to communicate their emotional distress online than to an adult or peer
        (Marchant, Hawton and Stewart). There is less discrimination on social media platforms and the ability to hide
        one’s identity while seeking suicidal assistance drives more teens to freely express their anger where no one
        really knows them. As a result of the false sense of safety and lack of judgement social media offers through
        anonymity, teens are more likely to post online without worrying about someone finding out. One possible
        solution is to give physicians access to examine these sentiments and perhaps find teens when they are at their
        lowest which helps to combat the issue of suicide and mental health illness as they have more understanding of
        the individual’s circumstances.
    </p><br>

        Offering teens anonymity on social media takes away their accountability as they don’t have to answer to anyone
        because no one knows who they really are. This obliterates any chance to identify the troubled teens and give
        them help in time. Sadly, this results in many deaths and suicides. However, through predictive policing police
        departments throughout the country can predict crime patterns and prevent them from occurring using only
        people’s data. Adopting the same approach and allowing physicians access to teenagers’ cellphones might equip
        them to be more proactive in fighting suicide rather than always reacting after the fact. Ren et al. compared
        public blogs of individuals who committed suicide to the blogs of randomly chosen individuals and found that,
        among those who committed suicide, their postings contained significantly more negative emotion and language
        (Ren, Kang and Quan). The signs of distress are there yet no one takes the time to pay attention to these teens.
        An analysis of Twitter postings revealed that two phrases, “want to die” and “want to commit suicide,”
        correlated with an increased odds ratio of suicidal ideation, self-harm, suicidal plan, and suicide attempt
        compared with Twitter users who did not use these phrases (Ren, Kang and Quan). Predicting suicide and signs of
        distress by monitoring teenagers could bring them help sooner before it’s too late.

        However, social media and cellphones aren’t the main cause of mental health issues and suicide. Other
        significant issues like bullying, relationship problems, past trauma, and chronic mental health suffrage in the
        family lead people to commit suicide. Professionals advocate people to offer help or listen when someone
        demonstrates signs of distress, ask if they have a plan in place, and advise them to seek professional help.
        (Rosenblatt). While it is always helpful to offer someone in distress some help, often it is difficult to notice
        as most people, especially teens, do well to hide or play down their feelings. Also, most individuals are not
        equipped or experienced enough to handle situations that would require professionals (Brady, Grabb and Koester).
        Using social media as a suicide prevention tool is already a common phenomenon as some websites and servers
        contain pages on suicide prevention and resources for those in crisis. Given how isolated most suicidal people
        are and how many teens are always by their phones, accessing their history and activity online offers the best
        chance to see what they are doing, and it puts professionals in a better position to handle the situation.
        Although physicians gaining access and using social media offers a potential solution to combat this problem of
        teen suicide, it is an unnecessary cure if the root of the problems is addressed. Without social media there
        would be lesser attempts as teens wouldn’t be subjected to detrimental content or offered a false sense of
        freedom. Teens will spend more time with their families and friends who unlike social media people, will be able
        to notice the red flags including the change in attitude and actions. This offers teens the best opportunity to
        get the help they need.

        Social media is to blame for many teen suicides due to the amount of exposure to negative content it gives to
        teenagers seeking ways to harm themselves and commit suicide. Despite the many ways physicians and health
        professionals have come up with to help teens suffering from mental health issues and combat suicide, the number
        of deaths related to suicide is still on the rise. Social media is to blame for the stressors that push many
        teens to commit suicide. Instead of blaming it on teenagers and not offering them enough assistance, there needs
        to be more aggressive policing on social media and better methods to recognize red flags before it’s too late.
