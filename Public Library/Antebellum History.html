    <h1><em>Three Key Aspects of Antebellum Period</em></h1><br>
    <p>
        The antebellum period was a time best known for the rise of abolition, and the division or polarization of the
        country between abolitionists and those who supported slavery. Due to the expansion of territory, the white
        Americans thought they had an obligation to morally spread institutions which demonstrated their superiority.
        This saw the rise of the industrial revolution in the north, and the booming of the cotton business in southern
        states like Louisiana. However, great as these progressions were seen by white Americans, they came at a cost to
        both free and enslaved African Americans. More workers were needed to work in the cotton plantations and help
        advance the industry in the north. Such sentiments as the need for cheap labor saw people like Andrew Jackson
        become president because he was in support with the South. Exploited, harmed, and dehumanized, most blacks had
        to flee slavery. Most went to the north, but not enough people escaped. For people going through adversity like
        this, there was a need for some influential beings or institutions. As a result, black schools, churches, and
        some black elites and white sympathizers were key aspects of the antebellum era as they played a great role in
        making sure the black family survived and saw that blacks came out of this period stronger.

        “Independent black churches sustained their communities.” (Gray White, Bay and Martin Jr 244-258). Most churches
        opened schools as with Philadelphia’s Mother Bethel which “sponsored school in the belief that education would
        both improve the lives of future generations and decrease white hostility.” Because of the link between
        abolitionists and integrated schools, attending schools with white kids was rarely an option as white parents
        greatly opposed them. One such instance is when Miss Prudence Crandall in Connecticut admitted a black girl into
        her school and the white families took their children away from it. She would later open the school only for
        blacks but then laws were passed making the school illegal. Although the law was overturned, she still faced
        backlash from whites who vandalized and burned the school.

        The role of the church also focused on uniting people and being a haven. Because there was a great number of
        slaves fleeing from slavery, churches usually harbored fugitives and kept them safe from the police. Also,
        churches became places for gathering to plan and discuss any resistance that was going on. Many abolitionists
        spoke in churches trying to motivate people to a common goal. Finally, churches offered hope through the belief
        in a supernatural power. This ensured people stayed united in the cause and through faith they got sustenance to
        persevere the injustice being done to them.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Lastly, it took the work of many influential people to sustain the resistance and abolition movement. Black
        elites and sympathetic whites in support of the abolition of slavery helped push the agenda of the slaves. Some
        free blacks bought their relatives to keep them away from plantations. Some whites hid slaves or helped them to
        escape, with some even getting involved in slavery so that they could free slaves. Through black press and
        media, blacks united and believed in one cause strengthening their endeavor for freedom.

        Although there were influential people in the antebellum period who helped advance the fight against slavery, it
        is worth noting that slaves themselves were influential. Their actions on plantations ensured their owners would
        improve the working conditions or risk losing them. Some slaves feigned sickness, broke tools or injured
        animals, while others fled the whole ordeal. These actions therefore make the slaves who were still under the
        control of slave masters significant to the whole abolition movement.
