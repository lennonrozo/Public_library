    <h2 id="1">Affordability of Healthcare</h2><br>
    <p>
        For Americans, in general, living in the United States currently the escalating price of decent healthcare is a
        constant worry. Perpetuated by the greater need for hospitals to stay competent and effective within a
        technological era, the burden is unfortunately laid on the innocent patients who cannot afford the prices which
        may seem exorbitant to most. The introduction of better healthcare technology leads to better yet more expensive
        procedures. With the vast drive for urbanization and consolidation, many smaller hospitals which were otherwise
        affordable to the general population end up closing and giving way to larger facilities run by moguls who value
        profit over impact on the healthcare system. Due to these and many more factors the general American cannot
        afford decent healthcare without piling up debt which eventually lead to unforeseen deaths which can all be
        avoided with a change in policies and cheaper healthcare for all.
    </p><br>
    <h2 id="2">High Cost of Living</h2><br>
    <p>
        The high tax rates in the United States help escalate the price of commodities like gas and food. For areas
        where the average income is lower than the national average, housing and commodities should be lower but due to
        high taxes there is an inverse relationship between the income and cost of living in many areas. Other factors
        like unemployment and crime rates force people to migrate to other places in search of greener pastures and
        peace but not necessarily in areas they can afford, leading to growing concerns of hunger, poverty, and
        homelessness.
    </p><br>
    <h2 id="3">Drug Addiction and Mental Health Problems</h2><br>
    <p>
        In light of the problems stated above, coupled with poor race relations, crime, and violence, and an increasing
        hardship for young people to find work because of lack of purpose many have resorted to drug and substance abuse
        seeking an escape from day-to-day problems. The increased burden on the general American, trying to raise money
        for college tuition, providing decent meals and healthcare while also creating long lasting memories with their
        children when they still can by traveling and visiting places, leads to mental strain and mental health
        problems. To abate this there should be better rehabilitation for addicts and education for everyone to
        understand the importance of mental wellness and the need for regular recess from day-to-day pressures.
    </p><br>
    <h2 id="4">Climate Change</h2><br>
    <p>
        In light of recent harsh weather conditions, unbearable heat and unpredictable storms, the effects of climate
        change are already upon us. Causing damage to property, loss of life and threatening the balance of the world,
        climate change has disrupted the flow of life affecting the way people live thus the social aspect to life.
        Combating climate change has seen the government invest money toward climate change thus affecting the economy.
        Whether it is unbearable heat that make people want to stay indoors or heavy downpours that destroy peopleâ€™s
        lives, or the economic aspect of it, climate change is a critical issue Americans cannot easily forget about or
        ignore.
    </p><br>
    <h2 id="5">Low Employment</h2><br>
    <p>
        Although statistics show that employment is on the rise, there is no denying that a lot of Americans cannot find
        work to support themselves or their families. As a result, people in marginalized communities suffer and end up
        resorting to drug abuse and crime putting the lives of all Americans, including upstanding citizens, at risk.
