        Study Notes to Look at
    </h1><br>
    <p>
        Critical reading is when someone reads not just to understand what the text is about. However, they read so that
        they will be able to evaluate the reading’s strengths, flaws and weaknesses. One example where critical reading
        is applied is when reading novels and articles to see if the author did an amazing job. Imagine how a food
        critique reviews dishes at a restaurant and how his or her comments may affect the whole business.
        The topic of the text is what the author seeks to communicate through their writing. Sometimes it is called the
        main idea or thesis. Supporting details help build the main topic and they could be evidence or research.
        People write to express what they are passionate about or to raise awareness on a problem. A genre is a type of
        classification of how a book is written and what elements it explores. Because there are many ways to tell a
        story, genre dictates the pace, themes etc.<br>
        A summary is a short description that paints a picture by condensing a story. However, an analysis is a more
        thorough look into the story, and it doesn’t necessarily have to be shorter than the original story.
        Literary elements are the parts of a story that bring it to life. Setting is where the story takes place, and it
        can also be the circumstances the story takes place in.
        Characters are the people in the story.<br>
        Plot is the direction the story takes, the events that happen and the effects they have on the characters.
        Logos are an appeal to logic. Pathos means appeal to emotion. Ethos means appeal to ethics or beliefs.
        Position arguments support a person’s point of view.<br>
        Proposal arguments convince the audience of a point of view and evidence may be involved.
        Primary sources are first-hand accounts of information.<br>
        Secondary sources are mainly from witnesses, magazines, or newspapers.
        Plagiarism is using a source without crediting the author. It can also be the case of using something that
        doesn’t represent your thoughts on a subject, like a paper from another class, someone else’s paper for the same
        class, or getting a paper from a website.<br>
        To avoid plagiarism always cite sources, ask your professor if you’re going to use another paper from another
        class. A quote shows someone’s exact words as they said them.
        Paraphrasing is using different words to achieve greater clarity.
        A signal phrase introduces a quotes, or it shows where someone else’s words are going to follow.
