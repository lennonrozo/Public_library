            Case Study: Identifying Stressors in College Students
        </em></h1><br>
    <p>
        College life is a period in many people’s lives where they make the transition from being a child to an adult.
        Regardless of gender, age, ethnicity, or background, everyone is bound to experience some form of stress be it
        from academics, relationships, drugs, or even lack of purpose. Looking at Sarah’s case, I hope to show the
        common stressors college students face regardless of their major.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        As a computer science major myself I know how demanding the core classes are, and although I am not going to
        make that the focus of Sarah’s problems, it could be one that has a greater impact on her. Also, having to do
        more demanding classes, Sarah might end up needing more time to study and work out problems compared to her
        previous classes.

    <p>
        The second thing that is apparent is the immense amount of activities Sarah participates in namely he part time
        job, coursework, and social life. All these taken into consideration could make the strongest of people falter
        when constantly experienced, especially by college students. Going to class in the morning and afternoon, and
        then working at night takes away most of the time that the students could use to study. This leaves the student
        with no choice but to take out some time from their regular sleep time and use it to be productive. This in turn
        leads to disruption in sleep patterns and deprivation of sleep which eventually lead to bad mood.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        As a college student Sarah needs to prioritize her health and take time out to take care of herself. Be it
        taking a nap, cutting out some activities or getting help, she needs something to distract her from time to time
        to rejuvenate. If not attempted earlier on, she will be more overwhelmed, and possibly burnt out.
