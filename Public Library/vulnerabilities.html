    <h1>Cybersecurity 101: Vulnerabilities in Daily Situations</h1><br><br>
    <p><em>1. What is the vulnerability being exploited?</em><br><br>
        The vulnerability exploited is the credit card security chip used to make instant payments on payment
        platforms.<br><br>
        <em>2. What information, data, or control can be gained by a hacker exploiting this vulnerability?</em><br><br>
        By scanning the victim’s credit card (Karp, 2023), the hacker gets access to the credit card number, expiration
        date, and their security code. Acquiring this information ensures the hacker has control over the credit card
        and they can make purchases with the victim’s card online without the card itself.<br><br>
        <em>3. How is the hack performed?</em><br><br>
        Using a scanner programmed to pick up user data and information, the hacker only needs to get close to the
        victim and scan their security chip which stores the card information. It’s a tap mechanism where the scanner
        just needs to be close to the card. After scanning the card, the victim’s information is displayed on a computer
        screen and the hacker can use this to steal money or sell the victim’s information on the dark web.<br><br>
        <em>4. What about this particular hack interested you specifically?</em><br><br>
        Because the security chip on credit cards was added for security, I’m surprised it is also the cause of
        exploitation from hackers. I was interested in learning how someone can use your money without even having your
        card. All they need is to get closer to me, either bumping into me or then scan my bank card. This goes on to
        show that some of the best security measures are also the most vulnerable. It only takes a smart hacker to
        expose the vulnerability and a lot of people will incur losses.<br><br>
        <em>5. How do you think this particular hack could be mitigated?</em><br><br>
        <strong><em>Whether</em></strong> using wallets made from reflective material which prevent interference like
        aluminum, or getting rid of
        the security chip altogether, there is still more that needs to be done. Since this method might only work with
        online payments, the best way to mitigate this is activating multi-factor authentication (Karp, 2023) so that
        even if the hacker has the user details, they need a code to successfully make purchases. Also, the use of
        biometric authentication (Onelogin, 2024) is the most secure since no one person is the same as another. This
        way it ensures that even with the victim’s information, the hackers cannot access their funds. Online platforms
        and stores should also be able to track the location where the purchase was made so that in the case of losing
        your information, the police and insurance companies can then track the hackers and stop them before they do any
        more damage. Finally, regulation and policies (Pfefferkorn, 2021) that heavily punish those who violate the
        privacy and security of others should help deter hackers and make them think twice before they commit such
        crimes.<br>
