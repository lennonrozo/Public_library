    <h1><em>Healthy and Wellness</em></h1><br><br>
    <h2><em>Time Management</em></h2><br>
    <p>
        During the Freshman Seminar we learned the meaning of time management and why it is important. Time management
        is how you manage your time, making sure each activity you do has enough time and itâ€™s done well. This is
        especially important to me as a college student because finding the balance between school, work, and life is
        critical. A good balance of time enables me to cover my school assignments, study, and get enough time with
        friends and family. Good time management is critical for success in college, and in life.

    <h2><em>Health and Wellness</em></h2><br>
    <p>
        One session that came to mind was the wellness and emotional health class we had during our Freshman Seminar
        class. We had representatives from the counseling center and a nurse practitioner at the school give us help and
        advice on the importance of our physical health as well as out mental wellbeing. Having a healthy physical body,
        and a serene mind is important, and it positions one to be able to succeed in college. Now, I take my physical
        and mental health seriously, and I know where to get help when I need it around my campus.
    </p><br>
    <h2><em>Physical and Emotional Health</em></h2><br>
    <p>
        In the same wellness and emotional health class we had, great emphasis was placed on how much we need to move
        our bodies and exercise. As movement creates energy, and keeps us healthy, so does exercising our minds and
        making sure our emotional health is well taken care of. As college students we go through many stressors, and it
        is important that we can identify them and deal with them. I am better equipped today because I know that as
        much as I need to recognize my own stressors, it is important to be able to notice that in others and help as
        needed.
    </p><br>
    <h2><em>Understanding Self-Discovery</em></h2><br>
    <p>
        Growing up I had totally different dreams from what I have today. As human beings we are influenced by the
        environment and also by other people. This can be a daunting feeling when you constantly wonder who you are.
        However, the Freshman Seminar class coverage of this topic helped me to be able to embrace the possibility of
        learning about myself and finding what I want to do the most and what my values are.
    </p><br>
    <h2><em>Paying for Education</em></h2><br>
    <p>
        When I was in high school my goal was to be able to get through college. My parents did and a lot for me, and
        they still do, but I still want to be able to take away some burden from them and do my own thing. As a result,
        I work so hard in school and get good grades to get scholarships to help with paying my own tuition. This is
        especially important as it teaches me the power of responsibility and the freedom to do things on my own.
    </p><br>
    <h2><em>Defining Your Future</em></h2><br>
    <p>
        Currently I am majoring in computer science, and I aspire to become a software engineer. This is what I see
        myself becoming. This was an important lesson from the Freshman Seminar class as it helped me realize that I
        must aim for something to get what I want. I have always been fascinated by computers and the programs you can
        create with them. However, as Dr. Dennis mentioned, what success looks like for me in college will not be the
        same 10 years from now. In that regard I intend to achieve my goals and be able to adapt with time and
        circumstances. There is always room for growth, and I intend to be the best I can be while also enjoying life
        with friends and family.
