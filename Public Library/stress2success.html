    <h1><em>From College Stress to Success</em></h1><br>
    <p>
        The talk from Brad Smith highlighted what students go through during their college life. As a student athlete he
        struggled to balance the time between classes and baseball, and often he ended up slacking in his work and
        failing his classes. However, as he described it himself, he was dedicated to success thus he came up with an
        amazing system to manage his learning experience.

        As a freshman myself and doing more credits this semester, I found myself agreeing to the talk from Mr. Smith as
        I identified with his story. Running from a part time job which leaves you feeling tired and then having to
        study afterwards is perhaps what I didn’t anticipate I would be dealing with. Between the extra workload from
        all the credit hours and the job, I often find myself in desperate need of a good night’s sleep. However, with
        assignments and due dates fast approaching, I have no choice but to trudge through the work neglecting my
        self-care.

        However, after seeing the video I also identified that it is not unusual for people to come up with systems to
        get the most out of their college education. I have been using scheduling to spread activities throughout my day
        to make sure I am not exhausted when it comes to studying. A few times I was frustrated when it didn’t work, but
        hearing from Brad Smith I realized that every system has its own setbacks and usually with refinement it gets
        better and more efficient.

        His system, “GO ACE!” is a good example of how setting goals and genuinely wanting something always gives
        results. Perhaps, the most important point is that students have to go to class if they want to succeed.
        Listening to a professor teach helps us understand in ways that studying alone can’t. When you read something,
        you heard the professor said in class it only bolsters and solidifies that idea in one’s mind making it harder
        to forget.

        Brad Smith also mentioned the importance of outlining in our textbooks, aligning our notes, condensing the
        material and finally explaining to someone. I’ve always known that teaching someone what you know is a great way
        to memorize and solidify that knowledge. As a result, I always look to help others when I can as we both can
        benefit from that.

        Finally, I think every student will benefit from listening to the talk as Brad explores topics that most
        students don’t know will enhance their learning and improve their success. After listening to the talk, I feel
        reassured in my own system, but I intend to adopt some skills from the speaker’s system and improve mine. I know
        the journey through college is a good learning experience and I am hopeful I can grow in all facets of my life.
