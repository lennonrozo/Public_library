    <h1><em>Transition to College, Culture, and Joining the Workforce </em></h1><br><br>
    <h2><em>Transtion to College</em></h2><br>
    <p>
        Making the transition from high school to college has been the biggest struggle I have had to face so far as a
        college freshman. In high school the schedules are manageable, but now it is hard to get time to yourself
        sometimes. Between classes and assignments, all the time is used up trying to stay afloat and end up rushing to
        submit assignments before a deadline. However, I seek challenges and enjoy being challenged. I try to submit my
        assignments on time and make sure I am not missing anything.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        The major downside to this fast-paced life is that I find myself exhausted by the time the weekend comes and
        struggling just to catch a break. During my one-year plan exercise I set a goal to schedule my activities and
        manage my time wisely. Also, most of my teachers are flexible enough and understanding to allow me to ask for
        help if I need it. Overall, the experience of college is one I think everyone should go through before joining
        the workforce.

    <h2><em>COllege Culture</em></h2><br>
    <p>
        As an international student having attended international schools most of my school life, I can say there are
        many things I experience in an American college that I didn’t see in my native schools. Rather than shunning
        change I have embraced these differences and learned from them, improving my skills, and enjoying life in
        school.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Perhaps the most visible change for me is the language spoken. Coming from a native school in my native country,
        I was used to learning with peers who speak the same language as me and it was easier to understand some
        materials as they were taught in the native language. However, having learned English from elementary school, I
        can say that I am quite proficient. This has helped in my studies here in America while also making it easier to
        communicate with new people and make new friends. The diverse number of international students, and people with
        origins from different countries makes it a vibrant society and each day I am learning interesting words from
        new languages.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        The second thing I noticed immediately is the issue of culture. When I was back in my native country, no two
        schools were the same. This was evident when I transferred from one school to another. While studying,
        collaborations and teamwork were the norm and culture in my previous school, the next school had a culture of
        arts, sports, and extracurricular activities. This proved to be a shock to me, and it took me a while to adjust.
        Coming to LeMoyne Owen College, I have realized that the culture is not mainly focused on academics alone.
        Others pursue athletics, crafts, or just enroll to fill time while they figure out what they want to do in life.
        This has broadened my perspective on life, and I am better prepared to face challenges because I can understand
        them from multiple views.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Overall, this is an eye-opening experience for me which I hope to savor to the fullest. Being surrounded by
        students of different ethnicities and ages, all with different interests makes college interesting as every day
        it’s like I am meeting someone new.
    </p><br>
    <h2><em>Joining the Workforce</em></h2><br>
    <p>
        The workforce today is more advanced and way effective than ever before. To keep it growing and improving,
        recruiters seek candidates with the best skills like critical thinking, communication, and being able to combine
        these with interpersonal skills. While critical thinking it the ability to evaluate issues objectively to form a
        judgement, communication on the other hand is the ability to relay one’s thoughts and ideas to others while also
        being able to receive and understand input from others. Interpersonal skills are the behaviors that one uses to
        interact with others.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        These qualities are significant in the workforce in the twenty-first century because unlike the past where
        specialization and working alone thrived, the workforce today encourages teamwork and cooperation. Someone who
        possesses all these skills is likely to be hired over talented individuals who can’t work in a team. Even though
        they may lack talent, their interpersonal skills make them a greater asset as they can lead and work in any
        team.
