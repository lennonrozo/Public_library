        They chose indifference, they chose death
    </h1><br>

        As humans we are often described as creatures of habits. We tend to not like change and want consistency. In a
        community where we are always in proximity to others, those habits begin to rub off on others. A ripple effect
        then ensures the whole community picks the same habit. However, it is still shocking when law abiding citizens
        pick up a bad habit to disregard their duty to the community. Their actions, or lack thereof, result in grave
        consequences. Gansberg’s article, “Thirty-eight that saw murder and didn’t call the police,” places the
        spotlight on such a community in Queens. Thirty-eight law abiding citizens saw a murder, or what led to it, yet
        no one called the police. They showed indifference towards another member of their community. Their lack of
        interest or sympathy killed an innocent young woman. Gansberg aimed to bring attention to people's indifference
        which is disturbing because humans should care when others suffer.

        When Miss Catherine Genovese, our victim, first laid eyes on her killer Mr. Moseley she was frightened. It was
        dark and intimidating, but because she was in a familiar place she found the strength to walk toward her
        apartment. “If anything should happen, my community has my back,” she must have thought. Unfortunately,
        something did happen, and Moseley attacked her. Miss Genovese’s community didn’t have her back. Their lack of
        interest led to her death.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        The first instance we see of this indifference is when Moseley first stabbed Miss Genovese. Her screams were
        loud enough to alert a neighbor who shouted at her assailant. Shouting alone was not enough to ensure the safety
        of Miss Genovese. As someone witnessing harassment, the neighbor should have called the police, but he didn’t.
        He didn’t show concern or sympathy for Miss Genovese. All he managed to do was scare away Moseley, who would
        return. Next, we see the indifference when Mosely returns. He had stabbed Miss Genovese but the lights from the
        neighbors’ windows scared him off. Multiple lights went on yet none of those people in the apartments called the
        police. The noise coming from outside was loud enough for them to get up, but they showed no interest in helping
        Miss Genovese. The fact that these were multiple people acting in unison shows a community united in
        indifference and not caring for someone who is in danger. Unfortunately, Moseley returned and his perseverance,
        although ill-placed, led to the death of Miss Genovese. On three separate occasions, the neighbors of Miss
        Genovese could have saved her life, but their lack of interest and sympathy led to her death. Thirty-eight
        people acted in unison, which shows that indifference had rubbed off on every one of those neighbors. In the
        end, Miss Genovese died because no one showed her sympathy or concern enough to call the police. However, the
        indifference didn’t stop there.

        When Miss Genovese’s body was found, the police were eventually called. Even then, no one stepped forward to
        talk to the police. Both in life and in death, this community chose indifference and failed Miss Genovese.
        Gansberg’s purpose is further highlighted when a neighbor says, “I was tired, I went back to bed.” These are the
        remarks of someone who didn’t have any concern or sympathy whatsoever for the victim. Surely someone who cared
        wouldn’t have given a silly excuse like being tired not to call the police when you knew someone was in danger.
        “We thought it was a lover’s quarrel,” said a housewife casually, and another couple said, “We were afraid.” The
        fact that multiple people demonstrated a general lack of concern or sympathy proves Gansberg’s purpose. These
        people didn’t care about anyone but themselves. Perhaps the most disappointing remark was when a couple,
        claiming to have seen the attack clearly after turning off their lights, failed to find a reason for not calling
        the police. “I don’t know,” said the wife with a shrug. I believe this is the best example which highlights a
        community that doesn’t care what happens to their neighbors. Another man had called his friend to get his
        opinion on what he should do, but still, he couldn’t bring himself to call the police. Instead, he ran across
        the roof and tried to convince another lady neighbor to do it. The indifference was so paralyzing that although
        this man knew the right thing to do, he needed to justify his actions before he could help save someone in
        danger. This is indifference at its worst.
    </p><br>

        Given that, “community is a group of people with a common characteristic or interest living together within a
        larger society,” I do not believe Miss Genovese’s neighbors did enough to save her life. Gansberg showed a
        community that failed to do its most important duty, to protect each other. Their common interests may not have
        been safety or opportunity, but people living together should care enough to worry if one of them might be in
        danger. Indifference destroys communities as there is no trust that your neighbors will protect you when it
        matters the most. This community chose indifference and their indecision killed Catherine Genovese. I would not
        live in a community where people don’t care enough about me and end up dying like Miss Genovese. I believe a
        caring community is united and happier than one where people just coexist without any concern for each other.

        Although the brutal murder of Miss Genovese took place in 1964, it feels as if it happened a week ago. The
        indifference shown to her by her neighbors is something we still experience today. People in many communities
        have a general lack of interest in their neighbors, and as a result nobody feels truly safe or relies on anyone.
        Take for instance the brutal murder of Goerge Floyd or the gun violence against kids in Memphis. The communities
        stand by and show no concern to these shameful acts. As a result, everyone looks out for themselves, and they
        think everybody is out to get them. This leads to a sense of paranoia which drives a wage between people in
        communities. The concept of community has begun to fade from modern day society. Families stay in a certain area
        because it’s closer to a job or school not because they want to be part of a community. Neighbors go for years
        without talking to each other, and more people avoid walking at certain times of the day because of fear. This
        again is a result of communities that show indifference. Indifference thrives where people are self-centered and
        possess a general lack of concern for the welfare of others.

        Whether neighbors are participating in the death of an innocent young woman or kids’ lives are threatened
        because of gun violence, indifference is a major factor in the demise of the community. Gansberg’s article, much
        to his frustration, demonstrated neighbors showing no concern for someone who was suffering. It is up to us to
        decide whether we want to continue living in indifference which results in the demise of people and communities
        or take up our duty to one another and provide safe and happier communities.
