        English Language
    </h1><br>
    <p>
        Every language regardless of its origin serves as a medium of communication among people. The English language
        is no exception. With a history as old, vibrant, and equally intense as the history of the Earth, it is no
        wonder many of its inhabitants know how to speak English. However, like the Earth which is forever evolving the
        English language continues to change gradually, and I believe it won’t be the same language spoken today many
        years in the future.

        The earliest history of English can be traced back to Briain in 5th century AD, and as the years passed the
        language has evolved. Due to factors such as invasions and migration of different groups of people, the English
        language spread like a virus everywhere these people went. As a result, new vocabulary and pronunciation emerged
        altering the language. However, these movements were haphazard enough so much that the same group of people
        didn’t stay in the same place long enough to stabilize the English language, and conform to some form of
        standard. Hence the language continued to evolve, and this trend would go on until the invention of
        groundbreaking technology.

        The first printing press came around in about 1440, and this would impact the way the English language
        developed. The first books were printed, and people had to read the same text. This resulted in some form of
        standardization in English, and the birth of spelling and grammar. Also, people began to learn to read and
        write, cementing the dialect of London as the standard. This went on for a while, but as people continued to
        migrate, conflict and wars raging, the language was influenced through different cultures, backgrounds, and
        dialects.

        Today the English language is not the same as it was back then, and I believe it will continue to change.
        Firstly, the need for lesser words has resulted in the language changing from the times of Shakespear to the
        modern day. People have realized that less is more, and it achieves the same objective effectively. Secondly, in
        a world where people from different cultures interact more than ever because of sophisticated technology, new
        vocabulary keeps being introduced. Also, besides fewer words, people are tending to use simpler words and short
        phrases. Other factors will lead to the continuous change in English like the advancement of technology which
        requires the discovery of new words to name new inventions, geopolitical conflicts which displaces people to new
        places where they learn new words, and the general tendency of people to be easily influenced by others which
        results in the English language continuing to take from other languages.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        In a nutshell, I believe the English language is changing today, and it will continue to evolve because it takes
        from other languages. Since language was used to discriminate against people in the time of William the
        conqueror, Duke of Normandy, the modern people will feel pressured to conform to what their peers are speaking
        resulting in a forever evolving language. The need for simpler words, shorter phrases, and new vocabulary will
        always be a constant in the English language as people try to make it as simple as possible to communicate.
