        This collection contains articles and pieces by some of the not-so famous authors from across the world. The
        criteria used to induct them into our library didn't just center on fame, but their ability to discern their
        thoughts and communicate them effectively. No wonder some of these names will be alien to the mordern day
        readers mainly because their goal wasn't to amuse the readers, but to educate and question norms.
