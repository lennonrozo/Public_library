    <h1><em>Reflections</em></h1><br>
    <p>
        On my first day in the Introduction to Power and Society class, I was lost deep in my thoughts trying to grasp
        what it all meant. At first glance it only sounded like a fancy name for another one of those college classes,
        but I was to be proven wrong. After a long day filled with many of my core classes, one would expect me to
        begrudgingly attend this afternoon lecture just to get credit for attendance. However, like all the good things
        in our lives, this was the only class I could look forward to regardless of the time.
    </p><br>

        The first thing I would like to reflect on is the power of knowing your own personality. Nelson Mandela said,
        “you can never have an impact on society if you have not changed yourself.” I agree with him. We all need to
        change to get to the next level in our lives. However, there is nothing more dangerous than a person who doesn’t
        know himself because they don’t see the need for that change. We went over the types of personalities including
        those who are dominant, influential, steady, and conscientious. While it is possible for us to exhibit behavior
        that resembles all types of personalities, it was important to know which category I lean to the most. Being a
        conscientious person, I am analytical and organized, and this helps explain my interests and actions. Knowing
        what appeals to me only helps me become stronger as I aspire to be useful and give back to my community. It
        gives me an opportunity to fine tune these skills and excel in career, relationships, and throughout all facets
        of life.

        Secondly, I learned about the power of being unique. “Being a purple cow.” My favorite inventor, Albert Einstein
        said, “everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life
        believing it is stupid.” When I hear those words, first, I hear that “you can.” With this mentality nothing is
        impossible. However, because of society and its expectations of us, we tend to lose belief in ourselves. Going
        through the purple cow example in class with Dr. Whitaker reminded me of the importance of being unique. The
        world needs someone with exactly the gift and talent that God installed in me otherwise I wouldn’t be here. This
        reminds me of a time when someone asked me if I feared death. Knowing that I am unique and seeing that I haven’t
        done what God sent me to do, I arrogantly replied, “God will not allow me to die just yet. And if he isn’t done
        with me yet, death is out of the question. How then can I be afraid.” I appreciate Dr. Whitaker because her
        lectures often remind me of the things I may take for granted and teach me new truths I need for my journey in
        this life.

        Having known myself and embraced my uniqueness, it was important that I learn to grow. This brings me to the
        third point of reflection, and it is the willingness to read. While there are many quotes about reading I could
        share, there is only one that resonated with me most. “Reading is important, because if you can read, you can
        learn anything about everything and everything about anything.” Today’s reader is tomorrow’s leader. The lecture
        on reading helped reinforce my love for reading. Not only was I happy to recognize some of the titles like “How
        to win friends and influence people,” by Dale Carnegie, I also found more titles I wish to read and grow from. I
        believe reading is the cheat sheet to success as it opens our minds and inspires us to see the world through a
        different lense.

        Next, is the equally important lecture on financial literacy and knowing how to handle money. Having gone to a
        boarding school, our parents always left pocket money for us with the boarding master. If anyone wanted to buy
        some snacks, they had to go to him first and get the money. One morning while preparing to go for a sports
        event, I also went to get some money for lunch from the boarding master. To my surprise, he was surprised to see
        me. In his words, “I acted differently from my friends when it came to money.” While my friends withdrew money
        every chance they got, this was my first time the entire semester. He told me I would be very successful if I
        didn’t forget that money works best if used for the things we absolutely need. Hearing the same remarks from Dr.
        Whitaker not only reminded me of my boarding master but allowed me to understand that our relationship with
        money should be one that serves us and not the other way around. Today, I can save money better and make
        informed decisions because someone took the time to show me the right way.

        Finally, I must reflect on the issue of soul ties. I grew up in an amazing community where the children only
        left the playing field because it was dark. Everywhere I went I easily made friends and I had an amazing time.
        However, I have come to realize that I find it hard to let go of people and places. To this day, I have
        impeccable memorization skills and even my parents are surprised sometimes when I remind them of a sound or
        sweet scent from the time I was a toddler. Such is the extent of my mind strength. While this enables me to
        retain information at school, remember people’s names easily or their important information, which makes me a
        good listener, I often wonder if this gift is also a curse. This brings me to soul ties. Because I recall
        sensations, conversations, and sometimes emotions, I find it harder to forget and let go of people I once
        cherished. As a result, I had started to refrain from making new friends or making new memories because of the
        time it takes me to finally let go. However, this didn’t sit well with me because I love to inspire and motivate
        people aligning with my God given purpose. This resulted in guilt knowing I wasn’t doing my best. Thanks to Dr.
        Whitaker, I found ways to sever those ties and move on, hopeful for the new memories of the future. Now I enjoy
        the moment and by imagining myself letting go of the people, or burning a paper with their names, and opening my
        arms to the future.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        I referred to almost all my reflection points as, “the power of,” because that is what they are. Each and
        everything I have learned from Dr. Whitaker’s class is a powerful arsenal that equips us for the journey of
        life. By knowing ourselves, understanding the cheat sheet to success, getting our relationship to money right,
        and embracing the power of the purple cow, I believe we are all on the path to greater things. Finally, having
        spent over three months in this class, I believe I have understood why it is called power and society. Dr.
        Whitaker’s class is like the rapture, powerful yet frightening that the only way we can use the tools we’ve been
        given is to impact society in a positive way.
